    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
     <p>
      My journey in discovering that photography was one of my main hobbies, surprisingly began with drawing inspirations from game designs. Specifically, games such as Roblox were of the most fascination to me. Developers ability to capture the beauty of the real world was mesmerizing. I felt drawn to do the same, however through the lens of a camera instead. Being able to recreate the beauty our eyes witness was an aspect I was most enchanted by.
